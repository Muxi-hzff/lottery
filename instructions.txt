Create a program will randomly provide seven lucky numbers, from 1 to 49.
Ask the user how many draws to make.
Limit the draw to a maximum of 6 draws. If the user entered a draw number >6, ask the user to resubmit a number which must be <=6.
use try and except loop to avoid user input error.
The user can also throw a dice to get a number.
